The Immersive Semi-Autonomous Aerial Command System (ISAACS) is an undergraduate research group within the Center for Augmented Cognition of the VHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality at the University of California, Berkeley. Our research focuses on human-computer interaction, with an emphasis on teleoperation and telesensing with quadrotors with applications in nuclear radiation collection and vizualization.

The ISAACS Virtual Reality Interface is part of our broader vision to help augment human perception, and integrates robot vision and radiation sensing with an intuitive User Interface that enables the command of a swarm of quadrotors. Currently, direct manipulation (using natural hand motion) of the mission-ready DJI Matrice 210 is supported, while sensor integration is still at an experimental stage.
<br>

This repository is focusing on the projects undertaken for applying the ISAACS system to nuclear radiation mapping and vizualization.

## Branches
Upstream development happens on the Alpha branch. Once most bugs have been eliminated, changes are pushed on the Beta branch for testing. The Master branch gets updated only when the interface is demo-ready.
